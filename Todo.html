<h1>Todo List for Sxslt</h1>

<h2>Done</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Parse an XSL stylesheet from text/memory rather than a file.
  <dd>   
    E.g. if we have it in memory via an HTTPS request, or if we
      construct it dynamically.
 <br>
    [Done]  Fix up the parse code, but basically working using
      xsltParseStylesheetDoc() routine.

  
  <dt>
  <li>  voidEval() so that we can ignore the return value.
  <dd> Done.

  
  <dt>
  <li> Finish the quoting of parameters.
  <dd>  Done - see fixQuotes

  
  <dt>
  <li>  Add a .params argument to xsltApplyStyleSheet to be able to
        specify the values as a list or character vector.
      Done.
  <dd> Allow for merging the ... and the .params.

      
  <dt>
  <li> Allow function to be registered from R.
       <font class="red">Same for variables/parameters.</font>
      Done.
      <p>
       Ideally want to get rid of the global  transformCtxt pointer.
      It is reset each time the extension is initialized and
      reset to NULL when that use of the module is completed.
      So it is "okay", but would be nice to remove it.
      We have removed the need for it in some via the
      function registration mechanism. So from within an R session,
      it is not necessary. And for stand-alone use, i.e. Sxsltproc,
      it is not really an issue.
      <p>
      <br>
    
  <dd>
  Somehow, we may have to register the function before
  processing the stylesheet. Turns out that this is not the problem.
<br>
  However, if we want to start R from the binary rather than the
      stylesheet (often convenient)
  such as when we are registering functions from R, we need a way to start R and run a script
  before compiling the style-sheet.
  This can be done using <code>--r=script/name/</code>
      <p>
      See the code in Sxsltproc.c.
      Need to find a way to get the Transform context.
      <p>
    Also, need a way to get the name of the function being called.
    Or some extra data that identifies the function.
    See the functions.c code in libexslt in the libxslt distribution
    and see if that relates to this notion.
      <br>
    Yep, we can get the function name. Now done.
      <p>
   Could use xmlHashTablePtr rather than a linked list.

  
  <dt>
  <li> Classes on an XSLT stylesheet returned from xsltParseStyleSheet().
  <dd>  Done.
